To create a Socket.IO client in JavaScript, you will need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Install the `socket.io-client` Library

If you're using a package manager like npm, you can install the `socket.io-client` library:

```sh
npm install socket.io-client
```

### Step 2: Create a JavaScript File for the Socket.IO Client

Here's a basic example of how to set up a Socket.IO client in JavaScript:

```javascript
// Import the Socket.IO client library
import { io } from "socket.io-client";

// Connect to the server
const socket = io('http://localhost:3000'); // Replace with your server URL

// Listen for the 'connect' event
socket.on('connect', () => {
  console.log('Connected to the server');
});

// Listen for the 'disconnect' event
socket.on('disconnect', () => {
  console.log('Disconnected from the server');
});

// Listen for custom events from the server
socket.on('message', (data) => {
  console.log('Message from server:', data);
});

// Emit events to the server
socket.emit('message', { msg: 'Hello, server!' });

```

### Explanation

1. **Import the Socket.IO Client Library**: Use `import { io } from "socket.io-client";` to import the Socket.IO client library.
2. **Connect to the Server**: Use `io('http://localhost:3000')` to connect to the Socket.IO server. Replace `'http://localhost:3000'` with your server's URL.
3. **Listen for Connection Events**:
   - `socket.on('connect', () => { ... })` listens for the 'connect' event, which is emitted when the client successfully connects to the server.
   - `socket.on('disconnect', () => { ... })` listens for the 'disconnect' event, which is emitted when the client is disconnected from the server.
4. **Listen for Custom Events**: Use `socket.on('message', (data) => { ... })` to listen for custom events from the server. In this example, we listen for a 'message' event and log the data received from the server.
5. **Emit Events to the Server**: Use `socket.emit('message', { ... })` to emit events to the server. In this example, we emit a 'message' event with some data.

### Step 3: Running the Client

Save the JavaScript file (e.g., `client.js`) and run it in your environment where you have set up a Socket.IO server running at the specified URL. If you're using a web browser environment, include the script in your HTML file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Socket.IO Client</title>
  <script src="/path/to/your/client.js" defer></script>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Socket.IO Client</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

If you're using a Node.js environment, you can run the client script using:

```sh
node client.js
```

This will establish a connection to the Socket.IO server and handle events as specified in the script.





// Import the Socket.IO client library
import { io } from "socket.io-client";

// Connect to the server
const socket = io('http://localhost:3000'); // Replace with your server URL

// Listen for the 'connect' event
socket.on('connect', () => {
  console.log('Connected to the server');
});

// Listen for the 'disconnect' event
socket.on('disconnect', () => {
  console.log('Disconnected from the server');
});

// Listen for custom events from the server
socket.on('message', (data) => {
  console.log('Message from server:', data);
});

// Emit events to the server
socket.emit('message', { msg: 'Hello, server!' });

The error you're encountering, `SQLite objects created in a thread can only be used in that same thread`, occurs because SQLite connections are not thread-safe. When you try to use the same SQLite connection in multiple threads, it leads to this error. 

To prevent this, you need to ensure that each thread or async task gets its own database connection. Here are some ways to handle this:

1. **Connection Pooling**: Use a connection pool to manage SQLite connections. This ensures that each thread gets a fresh connection from the pool.

2. **Pass Connections to Threads**: Create a new connection in each thread or async task.

Here's an example of how you can modify your code to create a new SQLite connection for each async task:

### Modified Code

```python
import asyncio
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
from collections import defaultdict
import json
import pandas as pd
from process import Indicator
from engine import AnalysisEngine
from minordb.db_controller import DBController

# Database Controller Initialization
# Removed global dbController to prevent shared usage in threads

def get_db_controller():
    return DBController()

def fetch_data(topic, db_controller):
    prev_data = db_controller.findStockDataByCompanyId(topic)
    columns = ['companyId', 'frame', 'open', 'close', 'high', 'low', 'volume', 'timestamp', 'UpperBand', 'LowerBand', 
               'MACD', 'MACD_Signal', 'MACD_Hist', 'vwap', 'rsi', 'obv', 'ema_5', 'ema_13', 'ema_26', 'supertrend']
    new_stock = pd.DataFrame(columns=columns)
    
    if len(prev_data) == 0:
        return new_stock

    for _dict in prev_data:
        data = pd.DataFrame([_dict])
        data = data.reindex(columns=columns)  # Ensure columns are in the correct order and missing columns are added as NaN
        data.dropna(axis=1, how="all", inplace=True)
        new_stock = pd.concat([new_stock, data], ignore_index=True)

    db_controller = get_db_controller()  # Create a new DB controller for this thread
    new_data = add_message_to_dataframe(topic, df_po, db_controller)
    new_data = new_data.to_frame().T

    stock = fetch_data(topic, db_controller)
    stock.dropna(axis=1, how="all", inplace=True)
    stock = pd.concat([stock, new_data], ignore_index=True)

    AnalysisEngine(stock)

    result_dict = (stock.iloc[-1]).to_dict()
    res = db_controller.insertStockData(result_dict)
    print(res)
    return stock.iloc[-1]

async def process_partition_messages(topic, message_queue, lock, executor):

            return result
        except asyncio.CancelledError:
            print("Task cancelled")
            break

class EngineServer:
    def __init__(self, host, port):
        self.host = host
        self.port = port
        self.partition_locks = defaultdict(asyncio.Lock)
        self.partition_queues = defaultdict(asyncio.Queue)
        self.executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=10)

    async def handle_request(self, reader, writer):
        try:
            # Read data from client
            message = await reader.read(1024)
            data = message.decode()

            await writer.drain()
        except Exception as e:

    await server.start_server()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    dbController = get_db_controller()  # Setup initial DB controller to create tables, etc.
    print(dbController.setup("./databases/stock.db", 35))
    asyncio.run(main())
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Removed Global DB Controller**: The `dbController` is not shared globally to avoid cross-thread issues.
2. **New DB Controller Per Task**: Added a function `get_db_controller()` to create a new `DBController` instance for each thread or async task.
3. **Reindexing DataFrame**: Ensured DataFrame has the correct columns and added as NaN if missing.
4. **Isolated Database Operations**: Database operations are now confined to the thread or task that initiated them, ensuring thread safety.

By making these changes, each thread or async task gets its own connection to the database, preventing the cross-thread SQLite usage issue.
