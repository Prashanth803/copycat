Subject: Access to [Tool Name] Still Pending ‚Äì Request for Follow-Up

Hi [Manager's Name],

I hope you're doing well.

I wanted to bring to your attention that I still haven't received access to [Tool Name], for which I raised a request approximately a month ago. I recently noticed that my name has been removed from the pending approval list, which seems to indicate that access has already been granted ‚Äî however, I can confirm that I still do not have access.

Could you please assist in checking the current status or advise on the next steps? I‚Äôm concerned this might impact my work if not resolved soon.

Appreciate your support as always.

Best regards,
[Your Full Name]
[Your Employee ID or Team, if needed]

Let me know if you want to include any request/ticket numbers or add a more assertive tone.



Great question. When your method involves multiple cryptographic components like:

KeyGenerator.getInstance(...)

SecretKeySpec(...)

Cipher.getInstance(...)


‚Äî each of these can fail in different ways, typically throwing NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeyException, NoSuchPaddingException, etc.

‚úÖ Best Practice: Define a Domain-Specific Exception

Instead of throwing all the standard Java exceptions up the stack, wrap them in a domain-specific exception like EncryptionOperationException or CryptoProcessingException.


---

‚úÖ Step 1: Define a Custom Crypto Exception

public class CryptoProcessingException extends Exception {
    public CryptoProcessingException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }

    public CryptoProcessingException(String message, Throwable cause) {
        super(message, cause);
    }
}


---

‚úÖ Step 2: Wrap All Underlying Exceptions

Here‚Äôs an example of how you might use it:

public byte[] encrypt(String data, byte[] secret) throws CryptoProcessingException {
    try {
        // Step 1: Get KeyGenerator instance
        KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance("AES");
        keyGen.init(128); // or your desired key size
        SecretKey secretKey = keyGen.generateKey();

        // Step 2: Create SecretKeySpec from raw key bytes
        SecretKeySpec secretKeySpec = new SecretKeySpec(secret, "AES");

        // Step 3: Get Cipher instance and initialize
        Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding");
        cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, secretKeySpec);

        // Step 4: Encrypt the data
        return cipher.doFinal(data.getBytes());

    } catch (NoSuchAlgorithmException | NoSuchPaddingException |
             InvalidKeyException | IllegalBlockSizeException |
             BadPaddingException e) {
        throw new CryptoProcessingException("Encryption failed", e);
    }
}

üîç Why Wrap in a Custom Exception?

You centralize crypto failure handling.

The calling method doesn‚Äôt need to know low-level Java crypto exception types.

Easier to log/debug and rethrow at appropriate levels.



---

‚úÖ If You Want to Be Even More Specific...

You can define multiple exceptions:

public class KeyGenerationException extends CryptoProcessingException { ... }
public class CipherInitializationException extends CryptoProcessingException { ... }

‚Ä¶but for most apps, a single CryptoProcessingException is enough unless your app must recover differently for keygen vs cipher errors.


---

Would you like help refactoring your current method with this exception pattern applied?



You're absolutely right ‚Äî and this is a key point in large refactorings like migrating from **Axis2 to Apache CXF**.

### üîÅ The Dilemma:

* **You want to delete the Axis2 stub files** to fully migrate.
* **But many parts of your code still import or use those stubs**, so removing them breaks compilation, and Rewrite recipes can't run.

---

### ‚úÖ Here's a Step-by-Step Strategy That Works

Instead of immediately deleting the Axis2-generated stubs, **transition gradually**:

---

### ‚úÖ Phase 1: Let Rewrite Help You Identify Axis2 Usage

1. **Restore Axis2 stub files temporarily** so the build can compile.

2. In your `build.gradle`, **enable OpenRewrite with this recipe**:

   ```groovy
   rewrite {
       activeRecipe("org.openrewrite.java.search.FindTypes")
       // This recipe will help us identify Axis2 usage.
   }
   ```

3. In your `rewrite.yml` file (create if needed):

   ```yaml
   type: specs.openrewrite.org/v1beta/recipe
   name: find.axis2.usages
   recipeList:
     - org.openrewrite.java.search.FindTypes:
         fullyQualifiedTypeName: org.apache.axis2.AxisFault
   ```

   You can add more like:

   ```yaml
     - org.openrewrite.java.search.FindTypes:
         fullyQualifiedTypeName: org.apache.axis2.client.ServiceClient
     - org.openrewrite.java.search.FindTypes:
         fullyQualifiedTypeName: org.apache.axis2.databinding.ADBBean
   ```

4. Run the Rewrite plugin:

   ```bash
   ./gradlew rewriteRun
   ```

   This will annotate or highlight all usages of Axis2 types.

---

### ‚úÖ Phase 2: Manually Replace Axis2-Specific Code

After identifying all usage points:

1. **Refactor the code manually or with additional Rewrite recipes** to:

   * Replace `AxisFault` with `javax.xml.ws.WebServiceException` or a CXF-specific exception.
   * Replace `ServiceClient` logic with JAX-WS `Service` and proxy usage.
   * Replace data-binding objects with JAXB-based CXF stubs.

2. **Then safely delete Axis2 stubs and dependencies**.

---

### ‚úÖ Phase 3: Regenerate Stubs with CXF

After Axis2 usage is eliminated:

* Remove the Axis2 dependencies and stub files.
* Use your `generateStubs` Gradle task to regenerate stubs from WSDL via CXF.
* Update service calls to use new CXF-generated service classes.

---

### If You Prefer a One-Shot Migration‚Ä¶

You could use **OpenRewrite‚Äôs custom recipes** to:

* Replace `AxisFault` with a more generic `WebServiceException`
* Replace all Axis2 classes with mocks
* Then **delete the stubs**
* Then regenerate CXF stubs and finally adjust imports

But in practice, **gradual migration** as described is more stable and manageable.

Would you like help writing custom Rewrite recipes to replace specific Axis2 usages like `AxisFault` or `ServiceClient`?




Great, Lisa. Here's exactly where and how to integrate that `generateStubs` task into your Gradle project.

---

## ‚úÖ Where to Place the Code

You should place this code **inside your main `build.gradle` file** ‚Äî typically found at:

```
<your-project-root>/build.gradle
```

---

## üß© Final Integration Steps

### 1. **Paste the code at the bottom of your `build.gradle`** file:

Place the following block **after** your `dependencies {}` block:

```groovy
configurations {
    cxfTools
}

dependencies {
    // Your existing dependencies...

    // Add these just below
    cxfTools 'org.apache.cxf:cxf-tools-wsdlto-core:3.5.3'
    cxfTools 'org.apache.cxf:cxf-tools-common:3.5.3'
    cxfTools 'org.apache.cxf:cxf-tools-wsdlto-frontend-jaxws:3.5.3'
    cxfTools 'org.apache.cxf:cxf-tools-wsdlto-databinding-jaxb:3.5.3'
}

task generateStubs(type: Exec) {
    def outputDir = "$buildDir/generated-sources/wsdl"
    def wsdlFile = "$projectDir/src/main/resources/service.wsdl"

    doFirst {
        file(outputDir).mkdirs()
    }

    commandLine 'java',
        '-cp', configurations.cxfTools.asPath,
        'org.apache.cxf.tools.wsdlto.WSDLToJava',
        '-d', outputDir,
        wsdlFile
}

sourceSets.main.java.srcDirs += "$buildDir/generated-sources/wsdl"
```

---

### 2. **Make sure your `.wsdl` file exists**

Put your WSDL file here:

```
src/main/resources/service.wsdl
```

If it's named differently, update:

```groovy
def wsdlFile = "$projectDir/src/main/resources/YOUR_FILENAME.wsdl"
```

---

### 3. **Generate the CXF Stubs**

Run this command:

```bash
./gradlew generateStubs
```

This will generate the Java client code in:

```
build/generated-sources/wsdl/
```

And your project will automatically include them in the main source set.

---

### ‚úÖ Optional: Use the Generated Classes

You can now create the client like this (based on the generated classes):

```java
MyService_Service service = new MyService_Service();
MyService port = service.getMyServicePort();

port.callSomeSoapMethod();
```

---

Let me know if you want to automate stub generation as part of the build, or need help refactoring old Axis2 code to use these new CXF stubs!
