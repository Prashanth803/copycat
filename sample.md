# Integrating Tests in Spring Boot with Gradle

Yes, you can configure your Spring Boot project with Gradle to automatically run tests whenever you refresh or build your project. Here's how to set this up:

## Option 1: Configure Gradle Build to Always Run Tests

Add this to your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
// This will run tests during every build
test {
    // Fail the build if there are test failures
    failFast = true
    
    // Always run tests, even when up-to-date
    outputs.upToDateWhen { false }
}

// Alternatively, you can make build depend on test
build.dependsOn test
```

## Option 2: Use Continuous Build (Recommended for Development)

For development, you might prefer Gradle's continuous build feature:

```bash
gradle test --continuous
```

This will monitor your source files and automatically rerun tests when changes are detected.

## Option 3: Configure IntelliJ IDEA (if you're using it)

1. Go to `File > Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Build Tools > Gradle`
2. Under "Run tests using", select "Gradle" instead of "IntelliJ IDEA"
3. Check "Run all tests" option

## Best Practice Recommendation

For most development workflows, I recommend:

1. Keep the default behavior where tests run during `build` but not during `refresh`
2. Use `gradle test --continuous` in a separate terminal during active development
3. Configure your IDE to run affected tests automatically when files change

This gives you better control over when tests run while still maintaining fast feedback.

Would you like me to explain any of these approaches in more detail?
